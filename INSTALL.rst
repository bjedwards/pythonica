Quick install
=============
::

	python setup.py install

or if you need it::

	sudo python setup.py install

Requirements
============

Python
------

To use pythonica you must have Python version 2.6 or later. I have not tested
it on earlier versions. You must also have the Mathematica MathLinks python module
installed. This is distributed with Mathematica, and usually resides in
/path/to/Mathematica/Version/SystemFiles/Links/Python. If you can run::

	import mathlink

Without any problems you should be good to go.
